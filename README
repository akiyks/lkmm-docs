This directory contains Linux kernel's LKMM (Linum Kernel Memory Consistency
Model) related documents, which are manually transformed into perfbook's
LaTeX typesetting framework [1].

List of included documents (from Linux -rcu repository [2]):

 - Documentation/memory-barriers.txt
 - tools/memory-model/README

To be included:

 - tools/memory-model/Documentation/README
 - tools/memory-model/Documentation/*.txt
 - Documentation/litmus-tests/README
 
[1]: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/paulmck/perfbook.git
[2]: git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/paulmck/linux-rcu.git

Unlike perfbook's repository, there is no Makefile or build script.

Just run:

    latexmk -pdf lkmm-docs-eb.tex

Page size is fixed to EBook size at the moment.
